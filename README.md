## Introduction

ContextVM (CVM) is a decentralized protocol that enables services to communicate over the Nostr network using public keys as addresses instead of traditional IP addresses, and relays as message buses. This paradigm shift eliminates the need for API keys, complex networking configurations, and makes services censorship-resistant and easily deployable from anywhere.

Key features:
- **Public Key Addressing**: Services are identified by who they are, not where they are
- **Sovereign Infrastructure**: Run your own services without third-party dependencies
- **Type-Safe Development**: Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for robust development
- **Dual API**: Services are accessible by both humans and AI agents
